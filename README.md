# Classification Models for Supervised Learning

#Overview

This Files consist of Classification model examples as well templates.
Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

##Dependencies

Anaconda (https://anaconda.org/)
Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
numpy (pip install numpy)
sklearn (pip install sklearn)
Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category.
